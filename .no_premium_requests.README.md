What this toggle does
----------------------

Creating the file `.no_premium_requests` at the repository root signals the assistant to refuse premium actions for this repository until the file is removed.

How to use
----------
- Disable premium actions (recommended):
  - Create the file (already created for you) or leave it in place.
- Re-enable premium actions: delete the file.

Quick toggle scripts are provided in `scripts/`:
- `scripts/disable_premium.sh` — create the toggle file
- `scripts/enable_premium.sh`  — remove the toggle file

Local enforcement
-----------------
A simple Git pre-commit hook is installed in `.git/hooks/pre-commit` that will block commits which modify game source files (for example `js/` files, `index.html`, `styles.css`, etc.) while `.no_premium_requests` exists. This prevents accidental commits of changes made by tools or automation while the toggle is active.

Notes and limitations
---------------------
- This is a local, repository-level safety measure. It does not change your billing or cloud account settings.
- The pre-commit hook must be executable; run:

  chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
  chmod +x scripts/*.sh

- The assistant will still require your explicit permission before performing any premium action. The toggle is an additional, local safety net.
